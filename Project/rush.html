            <h2>Rush Lake</h2><hr width=17%><br>
            <p> Rush Lake (Urdu: رش جھیل) is a high altitude lake located in Nagar Valley, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan near Rush Pari Peak, 5,098 m (16,726 ft). At 4,694 meters, Rush is one of the highest alpine lakes in the world. It is located about 15 km (9 mi) north of Miar Peak and Spantik (Golden Peak), which are in the Nagar Valley. It is the highest lake in Pakistan and 25th highest lake in the world.<br><br>
            Rush Lake and Rush Peak is reached via Nagar and Hopar Valley via the Hopar Glacier (Bualtar Glacier) and Miar Glacier, which rises from Miar and Phuparash peaks. The trek to Rush Lake provides views of Spantik, Malubiting, Miar Peak, Phuparash Peak and Ultar Sar.[citation needed]<br><br>The valley of Nagar is normally considered part of Hunza but as a matter of fact it is entirely a different valley. Nagar Valley is bigger than Hunza Valley, both in population and area. The Rakaposhi, Diran, Golden are located in Nagar Valley but nevertheless Hunza Valley is internationally more popular than Nagar.<br><br>This is a beautiful trek to Rush Lake at 4694 m with the ascent of Rush Peak (5200 m). Rush is one of the highest alpine lakes in Pakistan. It is located about 15 km north of Miar Peak and Spantik (Golden Peak). Rush Lake and Rush Peak can be reached via Nagar and Hopar and via the Hopar Glacier (Bualtar Glacier) and Miar Glacier, (which rises from theMiar and Phuparash) peaks. The trek to Rush Lake can be reached without the need for a long and difficult climb. Yet Rush Peak itself is a highpoint on a broad ridge that can be reached with relative ease. This ridge is almost 20km long and separates the glaciated valley of the Barpu from the steep sided Hispar Valley. It starts close to the town of Nagir and raises gently South Eastwards to culminate in a series of very steep unclimbed 6000m peaks.</p>
            <h2> Experience</h2><hr width=18%><br>
            <p>After a long journey of 46-hours I reached my destination guest house, Hoper Inn at Nagar Valley in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. I was to continue trek for the next 7 days towards Pakistan’s highest altitude Rush Lake (4697-M). I left from Rawalpindi at 6:30 pm one day before Eid and reached Gilgit next day after a 20:30 hours long bus ride. Then next three - hours I continued to travel in a mini Van to Aliabad, Hunza Valley on main KKH Road which leads to China via Khunjrab Pass (4693-M). <br><br>On my 2nd day trekking I moved upwards to Bericho Kor (3300-M) where a straight trek of 70-80 degree on a boulder ridge leads to Rush Lake, but unfortunately I could not follow this trek and found myself alone in the wilderness. I continued my trekking further upwards in this valley upto Chukutans by 5-hours and 3-hours back at Usai Miling and where I made my 2nd camping. Indeed I was alone in this 26-km long valley in wilderness except 2 younger brothers and their uncle who were living at Mulharai. They told me that three days earlier, one sheep was attacked and eaten by a bear. Later on some local tourists also disclosed that WWF also released nearly seven snow leopards in these highland mountain area in order to save their breed.<br><br> On my 3rd day alone, I was rather pessimist due to my failure to reach Rush Lake. I was resting when some tourists appeared on the scene who were trekking towards Rush Lake. They camped at Bericho Kor where actually a trek leads to Rush Lake. Usually all trekkers including foreigners with their porters were on way to Rush Lake (3494-M) were camping at Bericho Kor.<br><br>As soon we reached at Rush Lake, we were so mesmerized due to surrounding of high altitudes with icy peaks. The lake also remains covered with snow for 9 months and only 3 months its water shines under the light of sun. It was our luck that the weather was quite sunny but the temperature was really cold and freezing. We stayed here nearly 2 hours and took pictures and to the surprise of my fellow trekkers, I swam in the ever so gorgeous Rush Lake, located nearly 16000 feet elevation in the cold freezing water. All the local friends were so stunned about my thrilling activity. <br><br> At night we cooked Biryani. So on the 6th day in this valley I bid goodbye to all my amazing mates and the family of two sons whom I found mid way gave me dried apricot and almond as a gift. I took local van where my seat was already reserved from Hopar village to Gigit via Nagar-Hunza valley and arrived at Gilgit. Luckily after 10 minutes I found a direct Flying Coach from Gilgit to Rawalpindi.</p><br>
