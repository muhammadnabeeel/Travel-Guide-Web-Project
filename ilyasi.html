            <h1>Ilyasi Mosque</h1><hr width=25%><br>
            <p> In Nawanshehr there is a famous mosque that was built over a stream of water that flows from the mountain. The mosque stills stands to this day and still has water flowing underneath it. It is called Ilyasi Masjid. In front of it is a little pond-like area in which people can ride paddle-driven boats.A trip to historic Ilyasi Masjid. Ilyasi Masjid, the oldest and largest Masjid of Abbottabad built over a stream of water that flows from mountain, has an attraction for tourists with spicy pakoras being sold like hot cakes outside the Masjid.

            <h2> Experience</h2><hr width=16%><br>
            <p> I was in a trance, a feeling that I had never experienced before. When I entered the mosque through a small gateway, I saw people sitting around with their eyes fixed on its facade, admiring its beauty and praying to God Almighty.

            The air was full of a sense of peace and tranquility, soothing the people who had come there to offer their prayers. As I strolled towards the front area of the mosque I was captivated by an unidentifiable force. Located there was a pond with fountains as high as hills. A small part held the ablution area.<br><br>

            Before me stood the glittering white snowy structure of the mosque. It seemed as if the entire facade was covered with snow like the high peaks of the surrounding areas. The exterior of the mosque has exquisite carvings that artists seem to have made out of sheer respect and love.<br><br>
            As I made my way up the staircase, I saw a stream of water coming out of a pillar-like structure. I stopped there for a moment and asked the women filling bottles from the water if this was the ancient natural spring of Ilyasi Masjid? When they answered in the affirmative I was awe stunned and at the same time delighted that I had finally got to witness the wonder about which my mother told me when I was a child. Trust me I had goose bumps!</p><br><br><br><br><br>

            The Ilyasi Masjid is famous for having some of the best pakoras in Pakistan. The proximity of the Ilyasi Masjid is very convenient for travelers as it is on the road that leads to Nathia Gali. Travelers make a pit stop here before continuing towards their journey uphill.
